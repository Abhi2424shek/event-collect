The primary focus of this session is on the core Python programming language and standard library. How is the event held? The event is held using HP MyRoom (https://www.myroom.hpe.com). You will need to download a free client to attend. Dave has taught numerous courses using MyRoom--it has his seal of approval. Approximately 24 hours prior to the office hour, you will receive an email with a MyRoom Event code. What should I expect? Expect an interactive session of Q&A, live coding, chat, and a short challenge problem. Do I need to show my face? No. Although MyRoom supports video conferencing, it is typically not used and not required. Do I need to participate by audio? No. The session fully supports online chat as well as a question management system. Can I just listen in? Sure, no problem. However, you still need to register. If everyone just listens though, Dave might just blather on about the GIL or metaclasses through---it will be better if there are questions. Do I need to sign up or register for anything? Other than the EventBrite registration, you do not need to register or sign up for anything to attend. You only need the event code. You're not signing up for a new \"service.\" Is the session recorded? No. How many people can attend? The session is strictly limited to 20 people.", "privacy": "public", "background_url": "https://img.evbuc.com/https%3A%2F%2Fcdn.evbuc.com%2Fimages%2F26460582%2F2670688868%2F1%2Foriginal.jpg?w=1000&rect=150%2C0%2C1280%2C640&s=23196b72d8f0d5fb074b9b6c01c5d921", "type": "", "start_time": "2016-12-16T14:00:00", "social_links": [{"name": "Facebook", "id": "1"}, {"name": "Twitter", "id": "2"}], "ticket_url": "https://www.eventbrite.com/e/intermediate-python-office-hour-tickets-30006544382?aff=es2#tickets", "organizer_name": "abeaz LLC", "topic": "", "state": "completed", "end_time": "2016-12-16T15:00:00", "logo": "https://img.evbuc.com/https%3A%2F%2Fcdn.evbuc.com%2Fimages%2F26460582%2F2670688868%2F1%2Foriginal.jpg?w=1000&rect=150%2C0%2C1280%2C640&s=23196b72d8f0d5fb074b9b6c01c5d921", "creator": {"id": "1", "email": ""}, "id": "30006544382", "name": "Intermediate Python Office Hour by Dabeaz LLC"}, {"organizer_link": "https://www.eventbrite.com/e/intermediate-python-office-hour-tickets-30006544382?aff=es2#listing-organizer", "organizer_name": "abeaz LLC", "organizer_profile_link": "", "organizer_contact_info": "https://www.eventbrite.com/e/intermediate-python-office-hour-tickets-30006544382?aff=es2#lightbox_contact"}, {"microlocations": []}, {"customForms": []}, {"sessionTypes": []}, {"sessions": []}, {"sponsors": []}, {"speakers": []}, {"tracks": []}], "metadata": {"count": 9}}
